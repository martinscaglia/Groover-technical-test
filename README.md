# Groover-technical-test

> Here is my take on the technical test. 

I used a personal API (Express/MongoDB) using an IMDB database containing movies.
For the sake of consistency, I replaced the `/sendtrack/` route by `/createplaylist/`. 
This is the only digression from the subject I made.

More than 15 000 movies are available in total.

## To run the project

Just run `npm run project` in the project root folder :) Everything is already setup for you.
